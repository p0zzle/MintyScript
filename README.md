Bash for the automation of Minty (custom Mint fork) OS installation and final configuration.
This is a project I worked on a few years back. While it's not great, it was done with the idea of simplifying a long and tedious process which was relatively generic.
Important note; this was a project I worked on by myself, thus the reason why I upload it. Made it as generic as possible to avoid sensible data to be in it.
